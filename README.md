## About our App
This app is designed to solve the common queries and problems which
freshers generally face when they start their college life away from their
home town in an unknown place.
#### It contains following sections:

- **Fresher’s Section:** This section provides a lot of information which’ll
help a fresher make his/her life easier in the campus. There are
instances when a fresher has to wander here and there for things of
daily need just because he/she is not aware of the availability of the
resources in proximity. In order to get all these things first of all
he/she should be well aware of the institute’s map, so a detailed map
is provided. A list of trustworthy and safe eating joints and
restaurants, eateries inside campus, pharmacies, stationary, cycle
repair etc. is also present.
- **Notes and study material:** This section can be used to get notes,
previous year/semester assignments and question papers of all
subjects beforehand so that they don’t have to struggle for resources
at the time of examination.
- **Buy and Sell:** This involves exchange of things like aprons, lab-coats,
ED kits, musical instruments required for creative practices etc.
Seniors who own these things can upload its picture and their contact
details so that the fresher can have access to these things within the
campus and also prevent themselves from getting cheated by the
shopkeepers. Also, this is beneficial for those who can’t afford to buy
first hand things.
- **CP and dev:** They’ll have access to a list of coding platforms, video
lectures and websites which’ll help them have an early start and not
struggle at the time of internships. Links will be provided topic wise
also so that it can help them master that particular topic. 
This erases the confusion which everyone faces due to abundance of learning content
on internet.
